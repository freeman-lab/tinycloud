# tinycloud

Minimal module for launching compute clusters with node.js. Lets you spin up a cluster on Amazon EC2, monitor its status, and login to its nodes. Use and extend as a module, or use as a CLI with the help of `clicloud`.

There are already a couple great modules for cloud deployments, like kirby and pkgcloud, but they tend to be either very specific (targeting single nodes) or very broad (supporting compute, storage, etc.)

## install

Install as a command-line tool

```
npm install tinycloud -g
```

Or as a module in your project

```
npm install tinycloud --save
```
